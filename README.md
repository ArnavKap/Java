## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – Notes Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Notes Repository** — a structured collection of Java-based learning notes focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

This repository is organized in a topic-wise manner with theory and concept explanations stored in clearly named files, designed for quick understanding and easy navigation.

## 📦 Repository Structure

> 🔹 Each **folder** = a **major DSA topic** (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Graphs)  
> 🔹 Each **file** = a specific **concept or explanation**  
> 🔹 Source files contain **inline theory as comments**
